#Python-Practice
This repository outlines my experience and exposure to the Python language. 
This repository includes an assortment of .py files. 
The content invovles solutions to problems from the website called "https://www.practicepython.org/" 
I hope this helps show anyone my exposure to Python and my interests in learning this robust language. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this file and hope that the documentation in the .py files are clear.
